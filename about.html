            <h1>About Console Plus</h1>
            <p>Video games had humble beginnings, as anyone playing Pong in a dimly-lit bar in the 1970s can tell you. From those roots, gaming has grown to be perhaps the dominant form of artistic and cultural expression in the 21st century. It’s a field where technology blends seamlessly with creativity, where art competes with the demands of commerce, and where massive, world-spanning cutting-edge games can stand side-by-side with small independent creative visions. Unfortunately, through these changes, writing about games hasn’t seemed to progress.
                That’s where we come in.
                At Game Rant, we believe that gaming deserves writing that matches its creativity and vitality. We don’t just share the same headlines that everyone else does. We strive to provide in-depth content you won’t find anywhere else. We don’t just tell you what we think: we generate discussion with our in-depth, expert-driven content.</p>
